Very draft zfs port into zerovm.
- toolchain must be compiled with support of 4K size for memory page, this requirement my be pruned in the future;
- currently zfs-port forces an mmap pseudo emulation, due to bug in glibc memalign which can't allocate continuous sequences of memory pages;
- compile & run: cd src; make clean all; cd cmd/ztest; make clean all

TODO:
- Adopt multi-threaded architecture to single threaded;
- Add to zrt new custom mmap allocator and integrate umem memory manager into zrt instead of existing in glibc;
- Complete ztest app & pjd testing suite;
- Reduce vdev label size and move it from beginning of file to the end in order to get full COW filesystem.
- Integrate reduced zfs engine into zrt via MountsInterface;
